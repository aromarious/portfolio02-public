# English Expression Improvements

## Notes for Professional Communication

### Expressions to Improve

- "oh it improves certainly" → "Oh, it certainly improves" or "Yes, it definitely improves"
- "i want to get how to sure 'await'" → "I want to understand how to ensure 'await' works properly" or "I want to investigate how to guarantee 'await' behavior"

### Better Alternatives

When discussing async/await:

- "ensure await works properly"
- "guarantee async execution order"
- "verify await behavior"
- "investigate async flow"
- "confirm sequential execution"

### Bug/Issue Severity

- "それは重大な欠陥ですね" → "That's a critical defect/bug" or "That's a serious flaw"
- Alternative expressions:
  - "critical bug" (重大なバグ)
  - "severe issue" (深刻な問題)
  - "major defect" (主要な欠陥)
  - "serious malfunction" (深刻な機能不全)

### Architecture Discussions

- "誰がpostgresとNotion両方見える位置付けなの？" → "Which component can access both PostgreSQL and Notion?" or "What has visibility into both PostgreSQL and Notion?"
  - Note: More natural than "Who is in a position to see both postgres and Notion?" - using "component" or "what" is more appropriate for software architecture discussions.

### Code Quality/Logic Issues

- "なんだそりゃ" → "What the heck" or "That's ridiculous" or "What kind of logic is that?"
  - Professional alternatives:
    - "That's a flawed approach"
    - "That logic doesn't make sense"
    - "That's an incorrect assumption"
    - "That's not a reliable method"
  - Context: Expressing disbelief about poor code logic (e.g., distinguishing UUIDs by hyphens when both types contain hyphens)

### Expressing Confusion About Numbers/Calculations

- "計算合ってると思うけど" → "I think the math checks out" or "The calculation seems right to me"
  - Professional alternatives:
    - "The numbers add up correctly"
    - "The calculation appears accurate"
    - "The math looks correct"
    - "Those figures seem right"

### Data Processing/Recovery Operations

- "落穂拾い" → "cleanup operation" or "data recovery" or "gleaning process"
  - Professional alternatives:
    - "retry failed operations"
    - "process unsynced records"
    - "cleanup unprocessed data"
    - "handle failed synchronizations"
  - Context: Processing records that failed initial synchronization (like gleaning leftover grain from a field)
